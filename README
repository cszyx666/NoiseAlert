NoiseMonitor

A "noise trigger" application. Uses a media-recorder to listen on microphone
and periodically query the volume level. If a configured threshold is exceeded,
an event will be triggered to wake up the device and/or send an Android
broadcast. Will keep your CPU awake, so only use it when connected to mains!

This can be used to automate your Android device depending on surrounding noise
level.

Definitely no eye candy here, built using a lot of ugly code with duplicated
functionality and deprecated API calls -- forgive me, Java and app programming
is not my world. BUT it seems to work reliably, so I published it as it might
be useful for others. And refactoring pull requests are highly welcome. :)

The application has a main activity with a custom view object representing
a graphical sound volume display and a canned preferences activity. All user
interactions are triggered through the menu:

Start/Stop: start or stop monitoring
Test: activate monitoring without triggering any action to find right
  noise threshold.
Settings: Bring up preferences screen
